10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below:

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
lst = list()
for line in handle:
   line = line.rstrip()
   x = line.split()
   if len(x) < 3 or x[0] != ("From"):
      continue
   time = x[5]
   front = time.split(":")
   hour = front[0]
   counts[hour] = counts.get(hour,0) +1
for key,val in counts.items():
    new = (key,val)
    lst.append(new)
    lst = sorted(lst, reverse = False)

for key, val in lst:
    print(key,val)
